# start

[common]\
abstract fun [start](start.md)(): [Boolean](https://kotlinlang.org/api/core/kotlin-stdlib/kotlin/-boolean/index.html)

Initiates the service lifecycle. This method starts the service, allowing it to perform its intended tasks and transitions the service into an active state if possible. The behavior of the service after invoking this function, as well as its interaction with the `close` or `cancel` methods, depends on the specific implementation of the [ServiceLifecycle](index.md) interface.

Note that if the underlying CoroutineScope is not active, then this function will have no effect and will not start the service.

#### Return

`true` if the [ServiceLifecycle](index.md) is active, whether as a result of calling this function or if the [ServiceLifecycle](index.md) was already started, otherwise `false` indicating that the [ServiceLifecycle](index.md) is not in an active state.
